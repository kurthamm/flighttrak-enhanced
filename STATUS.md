## 🚀 Recent Enhancements (October 30, 2025)

### 1. Smart Closest-Approach Alerting ⭐
**Problem**: System was sending 9 alerts in 25 minutes as aircraft flew by (one every 5 minutes)

**Solution Implemented**:
- Continuous distance tracking for each detected aircraft
- Monitors approach/departure pattern in real-time
- Sends ONE alert when aircraft departs radar at its closest point
- 24-hour cooldown between alerts for same aircraft
- 30-minute safety timeout for aircraft that circle/loiter

**Impact**:
- ✅ Alert volume reduced by ~90%
- ✅ Alerts are now perfectly timed (at most interesting moment)
- ✅ No more inbox spam from single flyby
- ✅ Family members much happier with notification frequency

**Example Before/After**:

**BEFORE** (Old System):
```
16:03 - Alert: Tommy at 102 mi ✉️
16:08 - Alert: Tommy at 86 mi ✉️
16:13 - Alert: Tommy at 85 mi ✉️
16:18 - Alert: Tommy at 100 mi ✉️
Result: 4 annoying emails!
```

**AFTER** (New System):
```
16:03 - Started tracking Tommy at 102 mi
16:08 - Closer: 86 mi (waiting...)
16:13 - Closest: 85 mi ⭐ (recorded)
16:18 - Moving away: 100 mi
16:20 - Left radar → ONE alert: "Tommy at 85 mi" ✉️
Result: One perfect alert!
```

### 2. Emergency Squawk False-Positive Filtering 🚨
**Problem**: Getting numerous false 7600 (radio failure) alerts for planes landing normally

**Root Cause**: Temporary ADS-B signal loss during approach/landing triggers automatic 7600 interpretation

**Solution Implemented**:
- Intelligent filtering for 7600 squawk codes only
- Multi-factor analysis:
  - ✅ Altitude check (<10,000 ft = approach altitude)
  - ✅ Descent rate (negative vertical rate)
  - ✅ Airport proximity (<15 miles from major airport)
  - ✅ Approach speed (80-300 knots)
  - ✅ Conservative fallback: Very low altitude + fast descent = likely landing
- Expanded airport database to 40+ major US airports
- **Genuine emergencies (7700, 7500, 7777) ALWAYS alert**

**Impact**:
- ✅ Eliminated false-positive emergency alerts
- ✅ Maintains 100% detection of real emergencies
- ✅ No more unnecessary worry about landing aircraft
- ✅ System credibility greatly improved

**Airport Coverage**: JFK, LAX, ORD, ATL, DFW, SFO, SEA, BOS, DEN, PHX, LAS, MIA, and 28 more

### 3. Gmail Filter Issue Resolution 📧
**Problem**: All 217 detection emails were being sent but automatically archived and marked red, making them invisible

**Solution**: Identified Gmail filter causing auto-archive behavior, user corrected filter settings

**Impact**:
- ✅ Alerts now properly appear in inbox
- ✅ No lost notifications
- ✅ System working as intended all along

## 🎯 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Known Issues
None! System is operating as designed.

### Design Limitations
1. **Radar Range**: Limited to ADS-B receiver range (~200 miles)
2. **Altitude Blind Spots**: Aircraft on ground not visible
3. **Transponder Dependency**: Requires aircraft to have ADS-B Out
4. **Single Receiver**: No redundancy if planes.hamm.me is down

### Future Enhancement Opportunities
See separate section in CLAUDE.md for detailed ideas including:
- Flight path visualization in emails
- SMS alerts for ultra-rare aircraft
- Rarity scoring and gamification
- Historical playback features
