## üéØ Event Examples

### Search & Rescue Detection
```
üöÅ SEARCH & RESCUE OPERATION DETECTED
5 aircraft converging on rural area near 34.123, -80.456. Pattern analysis 
indicates coordinated search operation, likely for missing person(s) or downed 
aircraft. Aircraft deployment suggests serious situation requiring multi-agency 
response. Expect operation duration of 2-6 hours based on historical patterns.

Intelligence Assessment: High-priority emergency response in progress.
Confidence Level: HIGH (0.89)
```

### Law Enforcement Operation
```
üöî LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATION DETECTED
3 aircraft exhibiting pursuit/surveillance patterns near highway interchange. 
Coordinated air support suggests active law enforcement operation - possible 
manhunt, drug interdiction, or high-risk arrest. Flight patterns indicate 
ground units being supported from air.

Intelligence Assessment: Active law enforcement engagement.
Confidence Level: MEDIUM (0.76)
```
