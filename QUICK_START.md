## 🎯 Recent Improvements (October 30, 2025)

### 1. Smart Closest-Approach Alerting ⭐
**BEFORE**: 9 emails as plane flew by (every 5 minutes)
**AFTER**: 1 perfect email at closest point

**How it works**:
1. Plane detected → Start tracking
2. Monitor distance every 15 seconds
3. Wait for closest approach
4. Plane leaves radar → Send ONE alert
5. 24-hour cooldown

**Impact**: 90% reduction in alert volume!

### 2. Emergency False-Positive Filtering 🚨
**BEFORE**: Fake "radio failure" alerts every time plane landed
**AFTER**: Smart filtering based on altitude, descent, airport proximity

**Impact**: Zero false alarms, 100% real emergency detection!

## 📧 Your Alert Setup

**Recipients** (all get same alerts):
- kurthamm@gmail.com ✅
- jamie@jamiehamm.com ✅
- me@kathrynbaird.com ✅
- stacey@hammfamily.com ✅

**Alert Frequency**:
- Each aircraft: Max once per 24 hours
- Emergency squawks: Real-time (with smart filtering)
- Health alerts: If system sees no aircraft for 60+ minutes

## 🎨 What You'll Receive

### Aircraft Detection Email

## 🎯 How Smart Alerting Works

### Example Flyby
```
15:03 - Tommy Hilfiger's jet detected at 102 miles
        → System starts tracking

15:08 - Now 86 miles
        → Getting closer, keep waiting...

15:13 - Now 85 miles ⭐
        → CLOSEST POINT (recorded!)

15:18 - Now 100 miles
        → Moving away, past closest point

15:20 - Left radar range
        → Send ONE email: "Tommy at 85 miles (closest approach)"
```

**Result**: You get the most interesting notification at the perfect moment!
