# GitHub Discovery Optimization Guide

This guide shows you how to make your FlightTrak repository easily discoverable by people searching for ADS-B, flight tracking, FlightAware, and related aviation projects.

## ✅ Completed
- [x] README optimized with searchable keywords
- [x] Added "Perfect for" section with target audience keywords

## 🎯 Next Steps (Do This Now!)

### 1. Add Repository Topics (MOST IMPORTANT)

**Where:** Go to https://github.com/kurthamm/flighttrak-enhanced

**How:**
1. Look for the **"About"** section on the right side of the page
2. Click the **⚙️ gear icon** next to "About"
3. In the "Topics" field, paste these topics (space-separated):

```
adsb ads-b flight-tracking flightaware flightradar24 aircraft-tracking dump1090 python flask aviation aircraft emergency-alerts celebrity-aircraft real-time-monitoring email-alerts web-dashboard flight-radar aviation-safety raspberry-pi
```

4. Click **"Save changes"**

**Why this matters:** Topics are THE primary way people discover repositories on GitHub. When someone searches "adsb python" or "dump1090 tracker", your repo will appear.

### 2. Update Repository Description

**Where:** Same "About" section (⚙️ gear icon)

**Description to use:**
```
Real-time ADS-B aircraft tracker with smart alerts, FlightAware integration, emergency detection, and web dashboard. Monitors celebrity/government jets using dump1090.
```

**Character limit:** Keep it under 160 characters (this fits at 159)

### 3. Add Website URL (Optional)

**Where:** Same "About" section

**Options:**
- If you have a public dashboard: `http://your-domain:5030`
- If not, leave blank or link to docs
